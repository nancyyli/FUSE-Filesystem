Advantages and Drawbacks:
    Advantages: We do not store pointers in our filesystem structure. All of
    our structures are stored with offsets. This allows us to mount and unmount
    the disk image without losing any of the files and data we created. We
    followed Nats advice and used the basic ext filesystem structure for our
    filesystem.

    Drawbacks: Our filesystem currently is still very basic. It only has one
    directory, the root directory, where files can be created. There is
    definitely still a couple of missing functionality that we did not have the
    time to implement. However, all of our implemented functionalities work
    perfectly.

    If we had more time, we would improve our filesystem by implementing the
    missing functionalities.

    Features implemented:
        * Create files
        * List the files in the filesystem root directory(ls mnt)
        * Read/Write to small files(under 4k)
        * Rename files
        * Support metadata for files and directories (metadata is saved in each
        inode)

    Missing Functionality:
        * Deleting files (code exists but does not work properly)
        * Does not create nested directories (code exists but does not work properly)
        * Create hard/soft links
        * Read/Write to files larger than 4k
        * Remove directories

    We did not implement any additional functionality that was not required.
